How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped because the bug introduced into the new version was not present in the old one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
History is important to not make the same mistake again and again.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You are a programmer, you must have control over your work. Be smart and commit when it's needed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Useful.
